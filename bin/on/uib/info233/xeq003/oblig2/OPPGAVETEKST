1.
LivÂ´s algorithm should work correcly, though ineffective. It should implement a sorting algorithm on the bag input. I have used a very basic sorting algorithm: 
For (i to 168) { 
  //set temp lecture
  (for j to n) {Compare lecture j to temp, set new if better}
  //add temp to schedule
}

2.
The time complexity of the algorith i believe is 168 * O(N), where 168 is the maximum of lectures per week. O(N) is because the compare code runs n times, where n = number of lectures in bag;



Psst: I did not schedule enough time for this project. The code is not how I want it to be.




Improved algorithm which i did not have time to implement:

Start with sorting the classes by start day, then start hour. 
Save as array. Set first array element as temp. Set first element as int point to save location. 
(For i to n lectures) {
(while array[i].endHour <= array[point].endHour + maxLectureLength){
if (array[i].compareTo(tempLecture)) {array[i] = new temp;}
i++;
}
schedule.push(array[i]);
point = i + 1;
}
